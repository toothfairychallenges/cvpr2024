Welcome to the **ToothFairy Challenges: Supervised and Semi-supervised Multi-Structure Segmentation and Landmark Detection in Dental Data** joint-event for [MICCAI 2024](https://conferences.miccai.org/2024/en/)!

This event will host three challenges of MICCAI 2024:
>
- [`ToothFairy2`](https://toothfairy2.grand-challenge.org/): Multi-Structure Segmentation in CBCT Volumes;
- 3DTeethLand: 3D Teeth Landmarks Detection Challenge; 
- Semi-supervised Teeth Segmentation;

Together, the three challenges will organize a joint event called "ToothFairy Challenges: Supervised and Semi-supervised Multi-Structure Segmentation and Landmark Detection in Dental Data" at the MICCAI 2024 Conference. In this half-day joint-event, we will have a combined introduction and overview on the topics of maxillofacial image segmentation, followed by three sessions (1h each) devoted to summarizing and announcing the results of each challenge.

Our joint-event will take place on the 6th of October in Marrakesh, Morocco. Stay tuned for more information! Don't forget to checkout and register on challenge-specific websites.
